I used the paper titled "Sequencing the USDA core soybean collection reveals gene loss during domestication and breeding", published in The Plant Genome on June 24, 2021. The paper discusses how the soybean genome changed in the process of cultivation (modern soybean we are familiar with is not wild/wild type soybean).
I used the size of the genome in modern cultivars (varieties) and the average number of genes in modern cultivars to calculate average gene length. I need average gene length to have something to compare calculated gene length to in loop, since some indices of start and stop codons are such that the distance between them is too small for a gene to exist.# Gene-Prediction
